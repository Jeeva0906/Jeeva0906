# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing techniques. The code is written in Python and requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3 or above
- nltk
- sklearn
- numpy
- pandas

## Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the code:
your local machine git clone https://github.com/Jeeva0906
1. Clone the repository to 
2. Move into the project directory: `cd fake-news-detection`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the NLTK data required for text processing:
    a. Open Python interpreter: `python`
    b. Execute the following commands in the Python interpreter:

    ```
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    exit()
    ```

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the project directory: `cd fake-news-detection`
2. Execute the command: `python main.py`
3. The program prompts you to enter the news article:

    ```
    Enter the news article: [enter your news article here]
    ```

    You can provide a complete news article or a few sentences as an example.
4. Press enter once you finish entering the news article.
5. The program will output whether the news is real or fake.

Please note that the accuracy of the fake news detection might vary depending on the dataset and training model used. Make sure you have the appropriate dataset and training models ready for optimal results.

## Additional Notes

- You can modify the training models or add new ones to improve the accuracy of fake news detection. Make sure to train the model with a reliable dataset.
- It is recommended to test the program with various news articles to evaluate its effectiveness.

Data Source: The data source for fake news detection using NLP can be a collection of news articles from various sources, including both reliable and unreliable news sources. These articles should cover a wide range of topics and be labeled as either fake or real.

Description: Fake news detection using NLP involves using natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify news articles as fake or real. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of news articles from different sources, ensuring a mix of reliable and unreliable sources.

2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data, such as bag-of-words representations, tf-idf vectors, or word embeddings.

4. Model Training: Train a machine learning or deep learning model using the labeled data, where the labels indicate whether the news article is fake or real. Popular models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or recurrent neural networks.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques can also be employed.

6. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a real-time system or application for automatic fake news detection. New news articles can be input to the model, and it can predict whether the article is fake or real.
